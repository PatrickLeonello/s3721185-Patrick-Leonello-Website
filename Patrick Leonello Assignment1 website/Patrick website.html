      <h2 class="sectionContentTitle">About Me...</h2>
       
        <p class="sectionContent"> At the time of writing this, I am 21 years old. I was born here in Australia, like my parents, but I am of Italian descent. My mother’s side is from Collabria, and my fathers side Sicilian. English is my primary language, but I can pick up some Italian from being around my Nonna (grandma) a lot, trying to teach her how to use modern technology.</p>
<p class="sectionContent">&nbsp;I graduated VCE from Loyola College Watsonia in 2017, then completed a certificate 4 in screen and media and a diploma in live production and technical services at RMIT. These courses focused on the production of live television and live concerts.</p>
        <p class="sectionContent">&nbsp;A fun fact about me...I love to make videos! I highly enjoy the creative aspects of bringing an idea to life. I also enjoy the technical element of fluently putting together a coherent story that conveys emotion and a story from just raw footage. I have edited and filmed corporate training videos for Floorworld employee’s also highlight reels for AFLW star Monique Conti. I had so much fun doing both, but now I would like to learn about computing and IT and hopefully combine the two skills and make an advertising company in the future. </p>

<h2 class="sectionTitle">Interest In I.T&nbsp;</h2>

    <!-- First Title & company details  -->
    <article class="section2Content">
      <h2 class="sectionContentTitle">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h2>
      <p class="sectionContent"> Initially, my interest in IT solely lies in UCD (user-centred design)in the creation of applications and websites and how combining different design elements and principles  such as contrast, colour,  typefaces can all affect how the user interacts and feels and how that can influence their experience in positive and negative ways.</p>
      <p class="sectionContent">&nbsp;My interest in I.T. began at a young age, as I distinctly remember being amazed at the IMac we got to use in prep. From then on, I've always veered to I.T. subjects during schooling and always had a passion for the latest technology on the market, whether it be the latest Phones, gaming consoles or groundbreaking technologies on Hollywood film sets. I've enjoyed learning the basics of game development, Database skills, programming and Web development through the I.T. and Computing high school subjects. </p>
    </article>

    <article class="section2Content">
      <h2 class="sectionContentTitle"> Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your I.T. experience (if any).</h2>
      <p class="sectionContent"> The I.T. teachers I've had over the years, specifically Mr Tran, who has always been a good inspiration for my interest in I.T., he was so passionate about computing and information systems. He took what was at face value to be a very dry subject matter and turned it into an entertaining and informative experience that convinced me to learn more. Such YouTubers have also inspired me; Everythingapplepro, basically homeless, Mark Rober and Jerryrigeverything as I've watched them throughout the years explain and tear down the latest technology and create some pretty amazing things using I.T. and computing skills.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="sectionContent">My Favourite video being...&nbsp;&nbsp;
	  </p><iframe width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h4T_LlK1VE4">
</iframe>
<p class="sectionContent">&nbsp;In high school, I always chose the I.T. and Computing subjects in which I learned the basics of database management, web design, infographics, and a little bit of game development. Other than that, the first few weeks of the bachelor of information technology have been the bulk of my I.T. experience. I've learned some basics of programming using Python, management and development of databases, and user-centred design and web development using HTML. </p>
		<h2 class="sectionContentTitle"> Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
      <p class="sectionContent"> In 2017 I had a career meeting with the careers councillors at my high school who suggested an RMIT certificate 4 in screen and media as, at the time, I was focusing heavily on media. As mentioned in my personal information, I had already completed both a cert four and a diploma in media and live production at RMIT, specifically the CIty campus. So I know that the lecturers, facilities and equipment are top of the line. A benefit to the city campus RMIT is that it's only one train ride away. I was torn between a business I.T. course elsewhere and the bachelor of information technology course at RMIT and decided on RMIT based on my prior great experience at the university.</p>
      <h2 class="sectionContentTitle"> What do you expect to learn during your studies?
</h2>
      <p class="sectionContent"> During my bachelor of information technology studies, I expect to learn many skills through my different classes. Some of these skills are the basics of programming using Python to problem solve, the fundamentals of Information Technology and the development of websites, data networks also managing and building databases.</p>
      <p class="sectionContent">&nbsp;However, I understand that a lot of what I will be learning is not simply pieces of information that I can remember once and recycle whenever but are skills that I must develop and adapt to the industry to master over time.</p>

    <!-- Second Title & company details  -->
<article class="section2Content">
      <h2 class="sectionContentTitle"> Position</h2>
      <p class="sectionContent"> This employer requires a UI UX designer to join their team and assist in revamping the Melbourne-based company FramePlay's overall visual assets and evolving the existing features and functionality, and improving the UI/UX of their company app. 
        This position is particularly appealing to me because there are plenty of job opportunities in information technology—these range from security specialist, graphic designer to hardware engineer and database administrator. The user interface role has the aspect of the users and their experience. Creating a user interface that behaves as users would expect can often go unnoticed in a good way and how a poor UI can impact a person's overall experience negatively.</p>
      <p class="sectionContent">&nbsp;Another aspect that appeals to me is the company itself. Frameplay is an In-game advertising company. They have described themselves as "passionate gamers, designers and advertising experts", and their mission statement is to empower monetization to anyone regardless of skill level. This mission is something I would love to be a part of someday, helping others grow in the competitive market. </p>
		 <h2 class="sectionContentTitle">Skills</h2>
         <p class="sectionContent"> The position asks for a "highly skilled and super motivated UI/UX designer"; therefore, the User Interface Developer should be fluent in current web development languages such as CSS, HTML and Javascript. They must understand adobe creative suite programs, perform usability testing, create a web design that conforms to multiple devices, and overall have a masterful grasp of the world of UI/UX design.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="sectionContent">The application describes the use of tools/software such as Figima, an interface design and vector graphics editor. Jira is an issue and bug tracker and confluence and slack, which are both workplace collaborative software. My recent experience with user interface design revolves around what I've learnt so far in my bachelor course. I've grasped the basic concepts of usability such as learnability, efficiency and memorability. I have learned about the importance of feedback, surveys and users. Also, I have learnt about the heuristic evaluation.</p>
         <p class="sectionContent">The more human elements of this job require the applicant to be "agile, collaborative, creative, excited and friendly" and have many other positive Behaviours. A lot of what this career path upholds is user to designer interaction. User feedback is critical in all stages of developing a UI/UX. Also, it's a team effort in which you must learn to give and take and work collaboratively with others. I feel I already possess these qualities; however, they will have to be improved upon over time to meet a higher standard of professionalism. It's also required to have industry experience in advertising, gaming, science and the web. &nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="sectionContentTitle">Plan</h2>
      <p class="sectionContent"> It will be a long road To obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required. Firstly, I'd finish three years of bachelor in information technology. Completing the core courses needed to understand the body of knowledge for IT and focus my electives on similar elements to UI/UX, game development, advertising, graphic design, coding, and user-centred design. I would then need to gain at least three years of experience working in UI and gain experience in other areas of expertise such as advertising, gaming science, and web design through internships to gain work experience and other jobs such as junior UI designer and mid-level designer.</p>

<h2 class="sectionContentTitle">Myers-Briggs test results</h2>

		  <img src="AboutPageAssets/images/Five Factor results.PNG" width="700" height="" alt=""/> &nbsp;</p> 
<h2 class="sectionContentTitle">What do the results mean to you?</h2>
		  <p class="sectionContent">The 16 personality tests results show I'm an ESFP-T turbulent entertainer personality who is often described as social, witty, observant and enjoys nothing more than having good fun with friends. The online learning style quiz matched me with a 0.417 match to the reflector learning style. This means that I tend to be a cautious big picture type of learner suited to paired discussions, coaching or feedback from others. Finally, the Big Five Personality test results show that Factor III (agreeableness) is my biggest label meaning that I'm friendly and optimistic.</p>
 <p class="sectionContent">As much as I see myself as an optimistic, friendly Entertainer type of person, I feel that these test results aren't a perfect representation of who I am as a person. This is simply because, at such a young age, many people don't have the life experience to answer most of the questions asked in the quiz/surveys. I've never really needed to solely choose between my heart and my brain or delve into abstract theories, so that's why I feel these results do not fully define me.</p>
<h2 class="sectionContentTitle">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
		  <p class="sectionContent">In a team environment, I'd like to motivate, be friendly and open to some give and take when it comes to ideas and answers; however, I know that sometimes I can be too set on my opinions, but As the results above show, I am good at giving and receiving feedback and being involved in paired discussions </p>
		  <h2 class="sectionContentTitle">How should you take this into account when formatting a team?</h2>
		  <p class="sectionContent">Like I mentioned before, I don't see these results as fully defining a person as I feel they require adequate life experiences to answer truthfully fully. This being said, I will be gravitating to people who seem motivated, open-minded and friendly. This way, group discussions can be a safe place to share ideas and work together to create an optimal final product where everyone gives and takes equally. </p>

    <h2 class="sectionTitle">Project Idea&nbsp;</h2>
    <hr class="sectionTitleRule">
    <hr class="sectionTitleRule2">
    <!-- First Title & company details  -->
    <article class="section2Content">
      <img src="AboutPageAssets/images/Suggest.png" width="700" height="500" alt="" />
      <h2 class="sectionContentTitle">overview</h2>
      <p class="sectionContent"> My Project idea is an application called "Suggest". This Application's core idea is to create a program that allows you to suggest popular/niche Movies, music, TV shows, books, Games and more to friends, family or Randoms quickly and easily with a swipe of the finger. The Application will have a minimalistic design to come across straightforward and not overwhelming. The idea stems from constantly being suggested TV shows in which I forget to follow up on or don't know where to stream. The final Application will be as easy as Search, Swipe suggest! The user gets reminders on recommended media and shows available platforms to stream/purchase them.</p>	
<h2 class="sectionContentTitle">Motivation</h2>
      <p class="sectionContent"> Yes, Most websites and streaming services have the share button; however, according to Moovweb.com, who studied 61 million mobile sessions and discovered the "99.8% of mobile users never engage with social media share buttons". Showing there is a high level of engagement but next to no sharing to others. I believe that this is because there isn't any incentive to use a share button. It's simply not satisfying and might even come across as annoying to whom you're sharing. This is where the Suggest app comes in. It will be an utterly simple, enjoyable and rewarding experience for both parties with added graphics and serotonin inducing visuals and feedback to share your favourite media. </p>		 
<h2 class="sectionContentTitle">Description</h2>
      <p class="sectionContent"> Initially, my interest in IT solely lies in UCD (user-centred design)in the creation of applications and websites and how combining different design elements and principles  such as contrast, colour,  typefaces can all affect how the user interacts and feels and how that can influence their experience in positive and negative ways.</p>
<p class="sectionContent">&nbsp;The application theme will have a simple atmospheric dream-like quality to it with soft rounded and colourful bubble avatars/options, particle effects and almost liquid-like animations and graphics to keep it friendly and from overwhelming users. The app's audio will be at a minimum with only positive feedback sounds for pressing buttons sounding like soft pops and water droplets, and when sending a suggestion, a slight soft whistle noise. As the aim is to reward the users for every suggestion, the idea is to make the application a gratifying and satisfying experience to use. The inclusion of vibration feedback with every press will help this.</p>
<p class="sectionContent">&nbsp;The user will be able to select from different modes. These include the primary friend to friend suggestion mode and a mode where the user will be paired with people who suggest similar things (this way, the suggestion will more likely please both) and they both must suggest to each other at the same time. Group suggest mode where the users can form a watch group where you can send suggestions to a whole group of 3-6 friends. Finally, a mode where you are paired with a random with different or unexpected likes compared to you. That way, the user can broaden their media intake horizon. 
The users gained suggestions will be inserted into a section of the app that will provide information such as the date it was suggested, streaming/purchasing services available to view the media and which friend/user suggested it. </p>
<p class="sectionContent">&nbsp;To follow the theme of satisfaction, when a user completes viewing, listening or experiencing a suggestion made to them, they can 'pop' the bubble and are rewarded with a large amount of positive visual and audible feedback. They can then rate the suggestion based on how much they enjoyed it and leave a message to the user who originally suggested it. They can quickly suggest it to another person right there if desired. </p>
<p class="sectionContent">&nbsp;To make the user feel more in control most colours and avatars will be  customizable. </p>
		<p class="sectionContent">&nbsp;Restrictions will also be a part of the options in the applications for example  a mode that restricts explicit content suggestions (Family mode.). Another feature will be a mute suggestions option if you feel someone is suggesting too often.  </p>
 
			
	
		   <h2 class="sectionContentTitle">Tools and Technology</h2>
<p class="sectionContent">Many tools and technologies are required to complete the product. Firstly and, most importantly, a working PC or MAC. The design and planning of the applications programs like Moqups and Adobe Photoshop can be used for mock-ups and concept planning and even for creating the graphic design. Surveymonkey.com can be used throughout all stages of development to gather user feedback. To build the application, the use of Xcode and Swift, which have built-in code editors and debugging tools. You must use an iPhone to test prototypes of the application. This can be done using an Apple Developer account and Xcode; This requires a MAC. </p>
		 
		   <h2 class="sectionContentTitle">Skills</h2>
      <p class="sectionContent">For this project to successfully be completed, many skills are required. Researching competitors to improve on their ideas is one of these skills. It is also important to learn how to design and mock up the user interface. And then, learning to create a responsive and simple UI/UX  and graphic design is vital to producing a smooth, aesthetically pleasing app. At this point, user feedback is key to keeping on the right track, so skills in surveying and managing and using that data correctly is needed. To  build the app learning code such as Swift and using Xcode to edit code and debug.  While a lot of the core learning can be completed in the bachelor of information technology there are countless online short courses, website tutorials and youtube videos on the internet to gain the knowledge and skills needed to create the app 
</p>		 
		   <h2 class="sectionContentTitle">Outcome</h2>
<p class="sectionContent">Communities are built, and relationships strengthened when people can share, laugh, cry and relate to each other through mutual interest. The app Suggest can successfully bring people together through the sharing of everyday media intake. The share button was initially created so people could send suggestions to friends and family. People outside the digital world love to share! Also, it’s free advertising which is why on paper the share button is perfect; however, no one uses it. Why? Because there is no satisfaction, reward or incentive to do so. The application of Suggest will bring that much-needed gratification and a sense of community to the market.  </p>
